# omnes-git
Sprint project to create a git visualizer. I've been playing around with cli tools and then i got introduced to ink and thoght i'd give it a shot. This application is a git visualizer to better track changes and quick see commit hashes.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --global omnes-git
```

## Edit
```bash
npm run build

node dist/cli.js

# to test
npm run dev

node dist/cli.js

# To use globally run 
npm run link
# And now you can go into any directory and run:
omnes-git
```
